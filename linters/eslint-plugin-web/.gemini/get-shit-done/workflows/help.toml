prompt = "<purpose>\nDisplay the complete GSD command reference. Output ONLY the reference content. Do NOT add project-specific analysis, git status, next-step suggestions, or any commentary beyond the reference.\n</purpose>\n\n<reference>\n# GSD Command Reference\n\n**GSD** (Get Shit Done) creates hierarchical project plans optimized for solo agentic development with Claude Code.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n1. `/gsd:new-project` - Initialize project (includes research, requirements, roadmap)\n2. `/gsd:plan-phase 1` - Create detailed plan for first phase\n3. `/gsd:execute-phase 1` - Execute the phase\n\n## Staying Updated\n\nGSD evolves fast. Update periodically:\n\n```bash\nnpx get-shit-done-cc@latest\n```\n\n## Core Workflow\n\n```\n/gsd:new-project → /gsd:plan-phase → /gsd:execute-phase → repeat\n```\n\n### Project Initialization\n\n**`/gsd:new-project`**\nInitialize new project through unified flow.\n\nOne command takes you from idea to ready-for-planning:\n- Deep questioning to understand what you're building\n- Optional domain research (spawns 4 parallel researcher agents)\n- Requirements definition with v1/v2/out-of-scope scoping\n- Roadmap creation with phase breakdown and success criteria\n\nCreates all `.planning/` artifacts:\n- `PROJECT.md` — vision and requirements\n- `config.json` — workflow mode (interactive/yolo)\n- `research/` — domain research (if selected)\n- `REQUIREMENTS.md` — scoped requirements with REQ-IDs\n- `ROADMAP.md` — phases mapped to requirements\n- `STATE.md` — project memory\n\nUsage: `/gsd:new-project`\n\n**`/gsd:map-codebase`**\nMap an existing codebase for brownfield projects.\n\n- Analyzes codebase with parallel Explore agents\n- Creates `.planning/codebase/` with 7 focused documents\n- Covers stack, architecture, structure, conventions, testing, integrations, concerns\n- Use before `/gsd:new-project` on existing codebases\n\nUsage: `/gsd:map-codebase`\n\n### Phase Planning\n\n**`/gsd:discuss-phase <number>`**\nHelp articulate your vision for a phase before planning.\n\n- Captures how you imagine this phase working\n- Creates CONTEXT.md with your vision, essentials, and boundaries\n- Use when you have ideas about how something should look/feel\n\nUsage: `/gsd:discuss-phase 2`\n\n**`/gsd:research-phase <number>`**\nComprehensive ecosystem research for niche/complex domains.\n\n- Discovers standard stack, architecture patterns, pitfalls\n- Creates RESEARCH.md with \"how experts build this\" knowledge\n- Use for 3D, games, audio, shaders, ML, and other specialized domains\n- Goes beyond \"which library\" to ecosystem knowledge\n\nUsage: `/gsd:research-phase 3`\n\n**`/gsd:list-phase-assumptions <number>`**\nSee what Claude is planning to do before it starts.\n\n- Shows Claude's intended approach for a phase\n- Lets you course-correct if Claude misunderstood your vision\n- No files created - conversational output only\n\nUsage: `/gsd:list-phase-assumptions 3`\n\n**`/gsd:plan-phase <number>`**\nCreate detailed execution plan for a specific phase.\n\n- Generates `.planning/phases/XX-phase-name/XX-YY-PLAN.md`\n- Breaks phase into concrete, actionable tasks\n- Includes verification criteria and success measures\n- Multiple plans per phase supported (XX-01, XX-02, etc.)\n\nUsage: `/gsd:plan-phase 1`\nResult: Creates `.planning/phases/01-foundation/01-01-PLAN.md`\n\n### Execution\n\n**`/gsd:execute-phase <phase-number>`**\nExecute all plans in a phase.\n\n- Groups plans by wave (from frontmatter), executes waves sequentially\n- Plans within each wave run in parallel via Task tool\n- Verifies phase goal after all plans complete\n- Updates REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md\n\nUsage: `/gsd:execute-phase 5`\n\n### Quick Mode\n\n**`/gsd:quick`**\nExecute small, ad-hoc tasks with GSD guarantees but skip optional agents.\n\nQuick mode uses the same system with a shorter path:\n- Spawns planner + executor (skips researcher, checker, verifier)\n- Quick tasks live in `.planning/quick/` separate from planned phases\n- Updates STATE.md tracking (not ROADMAP.md)\n\nUse when you know exactly what to do and the task is small enough to not need research or verification.\n\nUsage: `/gsd:quick`\nResult: Creates `.planning/quick/NNN-slug/PLAN.md`, `.planning/quick/NNN-slug/SUMMARY.md`\n\n### Roadmap Management\n\n**`/gsd:add-phase <description>`**\nAdd new phase to end of current milestone.\n\n- Appends to ROADMAP.md\n- Uses next sequential number\n- Updates phase directory structure\n\nUsage: `/gsd:add-phase \"Add admin dashboard\"`\n\n**`/gsd:insert-phase <after> <description>`**\nInsert urgent work as decimal phase between existing phases.\n\n- Creates intermediate phase (e.g., 7.1 between 7 and 8)\n- Useful for discovered work that must happen mid-milestone\n- Maintains phase ordering\n\nUsage: `/gsd:insert-phase 7 \"Fix critical auth bug\"`\nResult: Creates Phase 7.1\n\n**`/gsd:remove-phase <number>`**\nRemove a future phase and renumber subsequent phases.\n\n- Deletes phase directory and all references\n- Renumbers all subsequent phases to close the gap\n- Only works on future (unstarted) phases\n- Git commit preserves historical record\n\nUsage: `/gsd:remove-phase 17`\nResult: Phase 17 deleted, phases 18-20 become 17-19\n\n### Milestone Management\n\n**`/gsd:new-milestone <name>`**\nStart a new milestone through unified flow.\n\n- Deep questioning to understand what you're building next\n- Optional domain research (spawns 4 parallel researcher agents)\n- Requirements

`/gsd:new-project`:\n\n**Interactive Mode**\n\n- Confirms each major decision\n- Pauses at checkpoints for approval\n- More guidance throughout\n\n**YOLO Mode**\n\n- Auto-approves most decisions\n- Executes plans without confirmation\n- Only stops for critical checkpoints\n\nChange anytime by editing `.planning/config.json`\n\n## Planning Configuration\n\nConfigure how planning artifacts are managed in `.planning/config.json`:\n\n**`planning.commit_docs`** (default: `true`)\n- `true`: Planning artifacts committed to git (standard workflow)\n- `false`: Planning artifacts kept local-only, not committed\n\nWhen `commit_docs: false`:\n- Add `.planning/` to your `.gitignore`\n- Useful for OSS contributions, client projects, or keeping planning private\n- All planning files still work normally, just not tracked in git\n\n**`planning.search_gitignored`** (default: `false`)\n- `true`: Add `--no-ignore` to broad ripgrep searches\n- Only needed when `.planning/` is gitignored and you want project-wide searches to include it\n\nExample config:\n```json\n{\n  \"planning\": {\n    \"commit_docs\": false,\n    \"search_gitignored\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Common Workflows\n\n**Starting a new project:**\n\n```\n/gsd:new-project        # Unified flow: questioning → research → requirements → roadmap\n/clear\n/gsd:plan-phase 1       # Create plans for first phase\n/clear\n/gsd:execute-phase 1    # Execute all plans in phase\n```\n\n**Resuming work after a break:**\n\n```\n/gsd:progress  # See where you left off and continue\n```\n\n**Adding urgent mid-milestone work:**\n\n```\n/gsd:insert-phase 5 \"Critical security fix\"\n/gsd:plan-phase 5.1\n/gsd:execute-phase 5.1\n```\n\n**Completing a milestone:**\n\n```\n/gsd:complete-milestone 1.0.0\n/clear\n/gsd:new-milestone  # Start next milestone (questioning → research → requirements → roadmap)\n```\n\n**Capturing ideas during work:**\n\n```\n/gsd:add-todo                    # Capture from conversation context\n/gsd:add-todo Fix modal z-index  # Capture with explicit description\n/gsd:check-todos                 # Review and work on todos\n/gsd:check-todos api             # Filter by area\n```\n\n**Debugging an issue:**\n\n```\n/gsd:debug \"form submission fails silently\"  # Start debug session\n# ... investigation happens, context fills up ...\n/clear\n/gsd:debug                                    # Resume from where you left off\n```\n\n## Getting Help\n\n- Read `.planning/PROJECT.md` for project vision\n- Read `.planning/STATE.md` for current context\n- Check `.planning/ROADMAP.md` for phase status\n- Run `/gsd:progress` to check where you're up to\n</reference>\n"
