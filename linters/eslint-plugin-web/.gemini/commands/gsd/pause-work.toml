prompt = "<objective>\nCreate `.continue-here.md` handoff file to preserve complete work state across sessions.\n\nRoutes to the pause-work workflow which handles:\n- Current phase detection from recent files\n- Complete state gathering (position, completed work, remaining work, decisions, blockers)\n- Handoff file creation with all context sections\n- Git commit as WIP\n- Resume instructions\n</objective>\n\n<execution_context>\n@.planning/STATE.md\n@./.gemini/get-shit-done/workflows/pause-work.md\n</execution_context>\n\n<process>\n**Follow the pause-work workflow** from `@./.gemini/get-shit-done/workflows/pause-work.md`.\n\nThe workflow handles all logic including:\n1. Phase directory detection\n2. State gathering with user clarifications\n3. Handoff file writing with timestamp\n4. Git commit\n5. Confirmation with resume instructions\n</process>"
