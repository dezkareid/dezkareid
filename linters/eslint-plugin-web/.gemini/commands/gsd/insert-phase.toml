prompt = "<objective>\nInsert a decimal phase for urgent work discovered mid-milestone that must be completed between existing integer phases.\n\nUses decimal numbering (72.1, 72.2, etc.) to preserve the logical sequence of planned phases while accommodating urgent insertions.\n\nPurpose: Handle urgent work discovered during execution without renumbering entire roadmap.\n</objective>\n\n<execution_context>\n@./.gemini/get-shit-done/workflows/insert-phase.md\n</execution_context>\n\n<context>\nArguments: $ARGUMENTS (format: <after-phase-number> <description>)\n\n@.planning/ROADMAP.md\n@.planning/STATE.md\n</context>\n\n<process>\nExecute the insert-phase workflow from @./.gemini/get-shit-done/workflows/insert-phase.md end-to-end.\nPreserve all validation gates (argument parsing, phase verification, decimal calculation, roadmap updates).\n</process>"
