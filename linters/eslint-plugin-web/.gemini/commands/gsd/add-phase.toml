prompt = "<objective>\nAdd a new integer phase to the end of the current milestone in the roadmap.\n\nRoutes to the add-phase workflow which handles:\n- Phase number calculation (next sequential integer)\n- Directory creation with slug generation\n- Roadmap structure updates\n- STATE.md roadmap evolution tracking\n</objective>\n\n<execution_context>\n@.planning/ROADMAP.md\n@.planning/STATE.md\n@./.gemini/get-shit-done/workflows/add-phase.md\n</execution_context>\n\n<process>\n**Follow the add-phase workflow** from `@./.gemini/get-shit-done/workflows/add-phase.md`.\n\nThe workflow handles all logic including:\n1. Argument parsing and validation\n2. Roadmap existence checking\n3. Current milestone identification\n4. Next phase number calculation (ignoring decimals)\n5. Slug generation from description\n6. Phase directory creation\n7. Roadmap entry insertion\n8. STATE.md updates\n</process>"
