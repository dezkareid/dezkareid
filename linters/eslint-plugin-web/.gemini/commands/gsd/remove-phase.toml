prompt = "<objective>\nRemove an unstarted future phase from the roadmap and renumber all subsequent phases to maintain a clean, linear sequence.\n\nPurpose: Clean removal of work you've decided not to do, without polluting context with cancelled/deferred markers.\nOutput: Phase deleted, all subsequent phases renumbered, git commit as historical record.\n</objective>\n\n<execution_context>\n@./.gemini/get-shit-done/workflows/remove-phase.md\n</execution_context>\n\n<context>\nPhase: $ARGUMENTS\n\n@.planning/ROADMAP.md\n@.planning/STATE.md\n</context>\n\n<process>\nExecute the remove-phase workflow from @./.gemini/get-shit-done/workflows/remove-phase.md end-to-end.\nPreserve all validation gates (future phase check, work check), renumbering logic, and commit.\n</process>"
