prompt = "<objective>\nExecute all plans in a phase using wave-based parallel execution.\n\nOrchestrator stays lean: discover plans, analyze dependencies, group into waves, spawn subagents, collect results. Each subagent loads the full execute-plan context and handles its own plan.\n\nContext budget: ~15% orchestrator, 100% fresh per subagent.\n</objective>\n\n<execution_context>\n@./.gemini/get-shit-done/workflows/execute-phase.md\n@./.gemini/get-shit-done/references/ui-brand.md\n</execution_context>\n\n<context>\nPhase: $ARGUMENTS\n\n**Flags:**\n- `--gaps-only` — Execute only gap closure plans (plans with `gap_closure: true` in frontmatter). Use after verify-work creates fix plans.\n\n@.planning/ROADMAP.md\n@.planning/STATE.md\n</context>\n\n<process>\nExecute the execute-phase workflow from @./.gemini/get-shit-done/workflows/execute-phase.md end-to-end.\nPreserve all workflow gates (wave execution, checkpoint handling, verification, state updates, routing).\n</process>"
