prompt = "<objective>\nValidate built features through conversational testing with persistent state.\n\nPurpose: Confirm what Claude built actually works from user's perspective. One test at a time, plain text responses, no interrogation. When issues are found, automatically diagnose, plan fixes, and prepare for execution.\n\nOutput: {phase}-UAT.md tracking all test results. If issues found: diagnosed gaps, verified fix plans ready for /gsd:execute-phase\n</objective>\n\n<execution_context>\n@./.gemini/get-shit-done/workflows/verify-work.md\n@./.gemini/get-shit-done/templates/UAT.md\n</execution_context>\n\n<context>\nPhase: $ARGUMENTS (optional)\n- If provided: Test specific phase (e.g., \"4\")\n- If not provided: Check for active sessions or prompt for phase\n\n@.planning/STATE.md\n@.planning/ROADMAP.md\n</context>\n\n<process>\nExecute the verify-work workflow from @./.gemini/get-shit-done/workflows/verify-work.md end-to-end.\nPreserve all workflow gates (session management, test presentation, diagnosis, fix planning, routing).\n</process>"
