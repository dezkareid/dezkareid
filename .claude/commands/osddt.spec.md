description: "Analyze requirements and write a feature specification"
---

## Instructions

1. Gather requirements from all available sources — combine them when multiple sources are present:
   - **Arguments** ($ARGUMENTS): use as the primary description of the feature, if provided.
   - **Conversation context**: consider any additional details, clarifications, or constraints discussed in the current session that are not captured in $ARGUMENTS.
   - **Research file**: if `osddt.research.md` exists in the working directory, read it and incorporate its findings (key insights, constraints, open questions, codebase findings).
2. Analyze the combined requirements
3. Identify the core problem being solved
4. Define the scope, user-facing constraints, and acceptance criteria
5. Write the specification to `osddt.spec.md` in the working directory
6. After writing the spec, check whether the **Open Questions** section contains any items:
   - If it does, inform the user: "I have some open questions — can we clarify these? You can answer them now, or run `/osddt.clarify` to go through them one by one."
   - If it does not (or the section is absent), proceed to the Next Step without mentioning clarification.

## Specification Format

The spec should describe **what** the feature does and **why**, from a product and user perspective. Do **not** include implementation details, technology choices, or technical architecture — those belong in the plan.

The spec should include:
- **Overview**: What the feature is and why it is needed
- **Requirements**: Functional requirements only — what the system must do, expressed as user-observable behaviours
- **Scope**: What is in and out of scope, described in product terms
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear, testable criteria written from a user or business perspective
- **Open Questions**: Ambiguities about desired behaviour or product decisions to resolve

> If `osddt.research.md` was found, add a **Research Summary** section that briefly references the key insights and user-facing constraints it identified.
> If additional context was gathered from the conversation session, add a **Session Context** section summarising any extra details, decisions, or constraints discussed beyond what was passed as arguments.

## Arguments

$ARGUMENTS

## Next Step

Run the following command to create the implementation plan:

```
/osddt.plan <tech stack and key technical decisions, e.g. "use Node.js with SQLite, REST API, no auth">
```
